This is my react.js code that allows the user to practice QuizBowl questions in a multiple choice format!

I originally started this project because I wasn't very good at QuizBowl when I joined WashU's team and I did not enjoy using QuizBowl pratice apps on my phone. I wanted a similar format as these practice apps but as a website. I spent some time with tutorials to learn how to use React, 
and from there, I created my WashU themed QuizBowl quizzer! I really enjoyed seeing how the website changed as my code did.

Thank you for checking out my code! :)
